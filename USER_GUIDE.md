## Core Workflow: Handling a Walk-in Candidate

This is one of the most common tasks you'll perform. Our platform makes it incredibly efficient.

**Step 1: Provide the Registration Link**
*   Navigate to the **Applicants** page within the "Talent Acquisition" module.
*   Click the **"Copy Walk-in Registration Link"** button. This copies a unique URL to your clipboard.
*   Provide this link to the walk-in candidate on a company tablet or kiosk.

**Step 2: Applicant Self-Registers**
*   The applicant opens the link and sees the registration page.
*   They can either upload their resume file or use the device's camera to take a picture of their physical resume.
*   Our AI will automatically scan the document and pre-fill their name, email, and phone number.
*   The applicant confirms the details and submits the form.

**Step 3: View the Applicant in the Dashboard**
*   The new candidate will instantly appear in the table on your **Applicants** page.
*   Click on the applicant's name to go to their **Unified Profile Page**. Here, you will see all their details, application status, and future assessment results in one place.

**Step 4: Assign Assessments**
*   From the applicant's profile page, you can assign them an **Aptitude Test** or a **Typing Test**.
*   Click the appropriate "Assign Test" button. A confirmation will appear, letting you know the test has been assigned.
*   The candidate will see a pop-up notification in their **Applicant Portal**, allowing them to start the test immediately. You do not need to send them any extra links.
